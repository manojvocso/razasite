<b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNT.</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This
is a multi-part open-end credit account. I will request a loan on this Account
by choosing the Bill Me Later payment option when I make a
purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized
location. Purchases will be added to the balance of the Standard Purchases part
of the Account, unless they are subject to special terms for Promotional or Installment

on each transaction date, except
during the Grace Period and as otherwise provided in the paragraph of this Agreement

   after I receive this Agreement, I agree to this Agreement.<br>

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4.  HOW I CAN OBTAIN LOANS ON THIS ACCOUNT.</b> 
</font>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>a. Standard and Promotional Purchases.</b> I can obtain loans on this Account by choosing 
the Bill Me Later option when I make a purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized location. 
You will make a loan to me, in the amount of the Cost of the purchase, by paying the Merchant on my behalf. You will make 
loans subject to the Standard Purchase terms, unless special Promotional terms are in effect at the time of the loan or are 
offered by the Merchant.<br>
<b>b. Installment Purchase.</b> You may offer me the opportunity to make 
purchases from some Merchants as Installment Purchases. You may offer this as the only method I can use to make a purchase 
from a Merchant, or as an option to the Standard Purchase method. If I make an Installment Purchase, the Merchant will inform 
me if it is a Financed Installment Purchase and of the payment amount and terms, before I agree to the purchase.<br> 
<b>c. Refinance of Closed-end Loan.</b> If I have any unpaid Closed-end Loans 
from you at the time I open this Account, I request that you refinance the Closed-end Loans by making a loan from this Account.
 The loans will be from Installment Purchase parts of the Account, subject to the same Finance Charges, if any, payment terms
 and End Dates as the Closed-end Loans that were refinanced.<br>

<b>(ii) You may charge my Account for Purchases.</b> I authorize you to charge 
this Account for the Cost of any purchase I, or anyone to whom I have given permission to use this Account, make from a 
Merchant using Bill Me Later. I understand that the amount that you actually pay to the Merchant may be less than the Cost, 
because the Merchant may agree that you may retain a portion of the Cost in order to participate in Bill Me Later.<br>

I authorize you to charge this Account for Finance Charges, any Other Charges, costs of collection, and amounts that I agree

               the balance on the Deferred Payment
          part (which is called the &quot;Current Balance&quot;) in full by the
           Expiration Date, you will not charge any Finance Charge for that part.
          
          You will calculate the Finance Charge for each Billing Cycle prior
          to  the Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as
          the 
          Accrued Deferred Finance Charge. If I do not pay the balance on a Deferred
           Payment part of the Account before the Expiration Date, you may charge
          
          my Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs,
           Finance Charges on each Promotional Purchase from the date of each
          purchase 
          (each&quot;transaction date&quot;).</font></li>

      <blockquote> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>End of Promotional 
          Terms. </b>If a part is subject to a special promotional rate, term, 
          or Deferred Payment option which ends as of a certain date, I authorize 
          you to move, on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part 
          to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject 
          to the repayment and Finance Charge terms for Standard Purchases. </font> 
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(iii) Installment 
      Purchases. </b>Each Installment Purchase will be a part. If there is a balance 
      owing on an Interest-free Installment Purchase after the End Date, I authorize 
      you to move, on or after the End Date, that balance to the Standard Purchases 
      part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and Finance 
      Charge terms for Standard Purchases. </font> 
    </ul>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>b. When the Finance 
    Charge begins.</b> The Finance Charge begins to accrue on the transaction 
    date, except Finance Charge does not accrue during the Grace Period, if applicable 
    to that part, and does not accrue prior to the End Date on an Interest-free 
    Installment Purchase.<br>
    <b>c. Grace Period.</b> You will not assess a Finance Charge on Standard or 
    Promotional Purchases during any Billing Cycle in which my payments and credits 
    on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard 
    and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases I 
    made during the Billing Cycle and Promotional Purchases which are subject 
    to a Deferred Payment option) to zero or to a credit balance. No Grace Period 
    will apply to a Promotional Purchase subject to a Deferred Payment option 
    or to a Financed Installment Purchase. <br>
    <b>d. How you will determine the balance on which the Finance Charge is computed. 
    </b>You will compute the Finance Charge for each part on the &quot;Average 
    Daily Balance&quot; (including new purchases) for that part during the Billing 
    Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, you will take the beginning 
    balance for each part each day and add any new loans and adjustments posted 
    that day; then subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid Finance Charges 
    allocated to that part. This gives you the &quot;Daily Balance.&quot; Then, 
    you add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle for that part and 
    divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is 
    the Average Daily Balance for that part. You will treat any Average Daily 
    Balance which is a credit balance as zero.<br>
    <b>e. How you compute the Finance Charge.</b> You will compute the Finance 
    Charge during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, you 
    will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number 
    of days in the Billing Cycle; then you will multiply the product by the Daily 
    Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result 
    is the Finance Charge for that part. You will then add up the Finance Charge 
    for all the parts, to get the Finance Charge for the Account.<br>
    <b>f. Minimum Finance Charge.</b> If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding
    any balance on an Interest-free Installment Purchase part), on the last day
    of a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the
    Finance Charge for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $2.00,
    you may assess a Finance Charge of $2.00 for the Billing Cycle.<br>
    <b>g. Rate of Finance Charge. </b>You will compute the Finance Charge on the 
    Standard, Promotional and Financed Installment Purchases parts using the Daily 
    Periodic Rate disclosed in the enclosed Important Disclosures. This corresponds 
    to the <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b> disclosed in the enclosed Important Disclosures. 
    However, if you have disclosed a special promotional rate at the time you 
    made the special offer, according to law, you will compute the Finance Charge 
    on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate.</font>
</blockquote>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>10. OTHER CHARGES.</b> 
  I agree to pay the following Other Charges, as applicable. I agree that you 
  may allocate any Other Charge to the Standard Purchases part of the Account. 
  </font> 
  <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>a. Late Fee.</b> 
    You will charge me a Late Fee for each month the Minimum Payment is not paid 
    in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the late fee is disclosed in 
    the Important Disclosures.<br>
    No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either:<br>
    </font> 
    <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(i) attributable 
      to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or<br>
      (ii) because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due.</font></blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>b. Return Check Fee.</b> 
    You will charge me a service charge of $25.00 if my payment on this Account
    is made with a check, including a draft, order or other instrument that is
    returned by a drawee for &quot;not sufficient funds&quot; in the account on 
    which the check is written. You will not charge the service charge, however, 
    if you redeposit the check and it is paid. <br>
    <b>c. Fee for providing a copy of billing statement.</b> Unless you are required 
    by law to provide me with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing Cycle 
    other than the current Billing Cycle, I agree to pay you a fee of ten dollars 
    ($10.00) per billing statement if I request a copy. </font></blockquote>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>11. MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE.</b> 
  The Minimum Payment will be due each Billing Cycle, on or before the Payment 
  Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due will be the sum of the Monthly 
  Plan Payments due on each Installment Purchase part plus the payment due for 
  the revolving parts plus any amounts past due from previous Billing Cycles. 
  </font> 
  <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>a. Revolving 
    Parts</b>. The payment due for the revolving parts will be the greater of 
    (A) $10.00; or (B) 3% of the sum of the balances on the revolving parts (excluding 
    any balance subject to a Deferred Payment option), on the last day of the 
    Billing Cycle. The payment will be rounded down to the next whole dollar. 
    In no event, however, will the payment due be greater than the sum of the 
    total outstanding balances on those parts. <br>
    <b>b. Installment Parts.</b> The Monthly Plan Payment due for each Installment 
    Purchase which has not reached its End Date and on which a balance is outstanding 
    will be the installment payment amount I agree to when I make an Installment 
    Purchase. The Monthly Plan Payments for an Installment Purchase will be calculated 
    so that they are substantially equal over the term of the Installment Purchase. 
    In no event, however, will the Monthly Plan Payment due for any Installment 
    Purchase be greater than the outstanding balance due on that part of the Account. 
    The Monthly Plan Payment due on the End Date may be more or less than the 
    others, because it will be adjusted as necessary to pay the actual balance 
    and accrued Finance Charge owing on the End Date. </font></blockquote>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b> 12. PREPAYMENT.</b> If I pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment 
  Due in any Billing Cycle, this will not affect the way you calculate the amount 
  of the next Minimum Payment, and I will nevertheless make the Minimum Payment 
  the next Billing Cycle. <b>I MAY MAKE PAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE 
  MINIMUM PAYMENT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME 
  PROVIDED THAT I PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN 
  IT IS DUE. </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>13. PAYMENT APPLICATION.</b> You will use each payment that I make, when 
  I am not in default, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on the Installment 
  Purchases (in any order you choose), then billed Finance Charge, then billed 
  other charges, then the principal balance of the revolving parts (in any order 
  you choose), and then any other amounts due. <br><br>
  <b>14. BILLING STATEMENTS.</b> You will provide me with a billing statement
  for each Billing Cycle in which: </font> 
  <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>a.</b> You 
    impose a Finance Charge to this Account; or<br>
    <b>b.</b> The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit balance).

  writing of any errors in the billing statement within 60 days from the date
  it is provided. I agree to examine the billing statement and to notify you

  me. You need not provide a billing statement to me if you deem this Account
  uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been started. <br>
  <br>

  <b>15. DEFAULT.</b> I will be in default if any of the following happen:</font>

    I fail to pay any Minimum Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date. <br>
    <b>b.</b> If I fail to keep any promise or perform any duty in this Agreement, 
    or in any other loan or agreement with you.</font></blockquote>
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If default occurs, you will have no duty to make loans or advances from this
  Account and this Account will be Terminated. You may refuse to make any new
  loans and may cancel any approved loans from the Account for any Purchase or
  transaction that has not yet appeared on a billing statement sent to me. This
  may happen without any prior notice to me. If you choose, at your sole option,
  to make new loans from this Account after default, I agree that you may charge
  those loans to this Account. In addition, if a default occurs, all amounts
  which I owe under this Agreement shall be due and payable immediately, at your
  option (subject to any applicable law to the contrary); you may apply any payments
  I make after default to satisfy the amounts I owe on any part of the Account,
  in any order you choose. The other provisions of this Agreement will continue
  to apply to this Account. If you get a judgment after default and/or if I am
  a debtor in an action filed by or against me under the Bankruptcy Code, unless
  prohibited by applicable law, the rates of Finance Charge applicable to this
  Account will continue to apply to the balances on this Account. A default under
  this Agreement is a default under every other account or loan which I have
  with you.

  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>16. TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNT.</b> In addition to Termination by default, you may Terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason subject to the requirements of applicable law. I can terminate my Account by sending written notice to the address on the billing statement. After Termination, I will not be able to make new purchases on this Account. Termination under this paragraph will not affect any purchase which complies with this Agreement and which was made before the date of the Termination notice. If you choose, at your sole option, to allow purchases after you have Terminated this Account (whether or not I have given you notice Terminating this Account), I agree that you may charge those purchases to this Account. After Termination under this paragraph, balances will continue to accrue Finance Charges until paid in full and I agree to pay the balance on this Account, the Finance Charges and all other amounts due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply.
