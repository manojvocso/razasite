                                Raza.com uses a 1 minute rounding interval. This means that the duration of each
                                call is rounded up to the next full minute for billing purposes. In contrast, many
                                prepaid phone cards use a 3 or 6 minute rounding interval where calls are rounded
                                up in 3 or 6 minute intervals for billing purposes.

                                <strong>Raza.com</strong> keeps track of the pages our customers visit within our
                                Website in order to determine what pages and services are the most popular. This
                                data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Raza.com to customers
                                whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
                                Our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and
                                frequency of visitors to our Website and its areas. This is similar to the way television
                                ratings tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such
                                data in the aggregate and not on an individual basis. This collective data helps
                                us determine how much our customers use parts of the Website, so we can improve
                                our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you
                                as possible.

                                do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information

                                server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                                Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the

                                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
                                you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
                                to a specific page. For example, if you personalize <strong>Raza.com</strong> pages,
                                or register with our Website or for our services, a cookie helps us to recall your
                                specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
                                your personal information, such as billing addresses, email addresses, and so on.
                                When you return to our Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
                                so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.

                                        The total minutes differ based on the destination number you dial each time, Hence
                                        whenever you dial a different destination number the system will prompt only the
                                        minutes remaining based on the balance in your account calculated w . r. t the rate
                                        for that particular destination number.
